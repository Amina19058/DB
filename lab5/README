Using psycopg2 I've created new table CUSTOMER in database and filled it with random data. Then I executed 
queries using EXPLAIN analyze statement to look how many time it is needed to get my queries executed.
Then I created indexes to optimize the time. I created age index which used hashing and name index which 
used btree approach. Time to get my queries executed decreased greatly. Thus, indexing can greatly improve 
our perfomance
